            📢 Repository Notice \
            This repository is now dedicated to maintaining the stable-1.1.x version of the Orchestrator, which is deployed using a Helm chart. \
            \
            ⚠️ Important: The installation method for Orchestrator 1.2.x has been changed to be operator-based. Development for this version now happens in the Orchestrator Helm Operator repository. \
            \  
            Additionally, this repository will continue to be the home for developing the orchestrator-k8s Helm chart. \
            \
            If this change includes changes to the orchestrator helm chart, please \
            close the PR and send it to https://parodos-dev/orchestrator-helm-operator instead"
