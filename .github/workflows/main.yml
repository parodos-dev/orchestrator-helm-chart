          📢 Repository Notice
          This repository is now dedicated to maintaining the stable-1.1.x version of the Orchestrator, which is deployed using a Helm chart.
          
          ⚠️ Important: The installation method for Orchestrator 1.2.x has been changed to be operator-based.
          Development for this version now happens in the Orchestrator Helm Operator repository.
             
          Additionally, this repository will continue to be the home for developing the orchestrator-k8s Helm chart.
          
          If this change includes changes to the orchestrator helm chart, please
          close the PR and send it to https://rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator instead"
